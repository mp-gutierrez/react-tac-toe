<h2>Description</h2>
    A straighforward Tic-Tac-Toe game worked on React.

<h2>Installation</h2>
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. After running a local server, you can go to http://localhost:8080/ to load and play the game.

<h2>Usage</h2>
    There's a grid with 9 squares containing one cross each. Starting with Player X, each click turns the mark into an X on the turn of Player X and into an O in the turn of Player O.
